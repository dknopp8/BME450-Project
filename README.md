## Project decription
The dataset is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is breast cancer tumor data with 10 variables with 9 features and 1 label. The label is whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

This project involves training a machine learning model to analyze breast cancer tumor data and classify the tumors as benign or malignant. The model uses various features such as 'Clump Thickness', 'Uniformity of Cell Size', 'Uniformity of Cell Shape', 'Marginal Adhesion' and other characteristics to make its predictions.

The goal of this project is to create a reliable tool for medical professionals to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.
