# breastcancerclassify
This project trains a machine learning model to analyze breast cancer screening images, classifying them as benign or malignant. Using features like 'Clump Thickness' and 'Uniformity of Cell Size', and L1/L2 regularization, the code aims to create a reliable tool for medical professionals in the diagnosis of breast cancer.
